###IS 117 Mini-Project 3 / Final

For this mini project, you need to take your content from project 2 and recreate your project using Bootstrap and Jekyl.  Your project needs to be hosted  on Github and should reflect a real portfolio that you can use to promote yourself.   You do not need a partner for this project and can complete it on your own.  You can use a Github theme; however, you must build it piece by piece and show through your commits how you worked.  IF you turn in a theme that is essentially just the uploaded theme you downloaded with only 2-3 commits that don't show your work, you will get a 0 on the project.

**Requirements:**

Show at least 20 commits labeled correctly with:
Task - for creating files and simple actions
Feature - for whole pages or major sections of a page like a carousel or jumbotron 
Fix - Fixing mistakes
